# Connect 4

## About the Project

This is the classic 2-player game of Connect 4. Play against another player by taking turns on the same machine and see who can connect four disks first!

## Installation

1. Make sure you have installed <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp">Java</a> on your system
2. Install <a href="https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html">NetBeans</a> to run the program
3. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Serylda/Connect4.git
```

## Playing the Game

1. Open Apache NetBeans
2. Click "File" -> "Open Project..."
3. Select "Connect4"
4. Navigate to Connect4\src\main\java\Connect4 to view the source code
5. Run ```Window.java``` to launch the game

Once the game is opened on a Java Swing GUI window, you should be on the "Login" tab that displays the title of the game. Click on the "Game" tab to play the game. 2 players are required to play. The players will alternate turns. Players will select a column to drop a disc in. The game will continue until a player gets 4 of their discs next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The game may even tie if this doesn't occur for either player but the grid becomes full. The game can be reset by pressing the "End Game" button.
